# How to setup app in a Docker based environment (Linux)

The development of this application is done on Visual Studio IDE on a Windows machine. Setting up the app in a Docker based environment enables developers of non-Windows origins to run the backend application on their machine to test the APIs.

## Steps

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your machine. Choose to follow the instructions based on your device OS.
2. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). A separate installation is required for Linux based OS. If you are using Windows or MacOS, installing the Docker Desktop app includes Docker Compose.
3. Clone the project `document-service`.
4. (Optional) [Install Docker Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker).
5. Set `environment` variables `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` and `BUILD_CONFIGURATION` as per requirement in [docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml). Ensure correct formatting:

#### Development (Default Configuration)
```yaml
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
      - BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Debug
```

#### Production
```yaml
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
      - BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
```

6. Ensure Docker is running. Then, in root directory of project, execute the following command to build container for `document-service`:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up
```

7. Project will run on `http://localhost:5000`.
8. You can access the **Swagger UI** at `http:localhost:5000/swagger/index.html` in **Development Enviroment**.
9. Test the API via **Postman**. The app can be accessed using `http://localhost:5000/<API>`.

# How to setup library (Windows)

## Steps for installing wkhtmltopdf
- Go to website: https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html
- Select the version of wkhtmltopdf installer that you need to download based on your system requirements.
- Finish Installation.

## Including wkhtmltopdf executable file to build package
- Go to the location to the bin files of your project where the DocumentService DLL is located.
- Create a folder called Tools and place the wkhtmltopdf.exe file there. wkhtmltopdf.exe can be found in the Program Files in C directory after it is installed.

Note: We are using a Temp folder to temporarily hold the modified html file before converting it to PDF file. After the conversion is done, the temporary file is removed.The code is already provided with the location of temp file so no modification required in code and the temp folder will be used automatically.

# Basic usage

## PDF generation
```csharp
List<ContentMetaData> contentList = new List<ContentMetaData>
{
    new ContentMetaData { Placeholder = "Incident UID", Content = "I-20230822-001" },
    new ContentMetaData { Placeholder = "Description", Content = "Suspicious activity reported" },
    new ContentMetaData { Placeholder = "Site", Content = "Headquarters" }
};

// Tools\\index.html - The path of the html template file in which changes are to be made.
// Tools\\OutputFile.pdf - The path of the final pdf output file.
PdfDocumentGenerator.GeneratePdfByTemplate("Tools\\index.html", contentList, "Tools\\OutputFile.pdf");
```

## Word document generation
```csharp
string templateFilePath = @"C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Osmosys\Work\Projects\Document Service Component\Testing\Document.docx";
string outputFilePath = @"C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Osmosys\Work\Projects\Document Service Component\Testing\Test_Output.docx";

List<TableData> tablesData = new List<TableData>()
    {
        new TableData()
            {
                TablePos = 5,
                Data = new List<Dictionary<string, string>>()
                {
                    new Dictionary<string, string>()
                    {
                        { "Item Name", "1st med" },
                        { "Dosage", "1" },
                        { "Quantity", "1" },
                        { "Precautions", "Take care" }
                    },
                    new Dictionary<string, string>()
                    {
                        { "Item Name", "2nd med" },
                        { "Dosage", "1" },
                        { "Quantity", "1" },
                    }
                }
            }
    };

    List<ContentData> contents = new List<ContentData>()
    {
        new ContentData
        {
            Placeholder = "Picture 1",
            Content = @"../testImage1.jpg",
            ContentType = ContentType.Image,
            ParentBody = ParentBody.None
        },
        new ContentData
        {
            Placeholder = "Picture 2",
            Content = @"../testImage2.jpg",
            ContentType = ContentType.Image,
            ParentBody = ParentBody.None
        },
    };

    DocumentData documentData = new DocumentData()
    {
        Placeholders = contents,
        TablesData = tablesData
    };

    WordDocumentGenerator.GenerateDocumentByTemplate(templateFilePath, documentData, outputFilePath);
```
